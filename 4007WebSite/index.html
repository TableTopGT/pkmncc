        <h3> Project Description </h3>
        
        <ul> <img src="images/pokeMat.png" style="float:right"/> 
        Team TableTop is developing Pokemon Card Coliseum, an interface between the traditional Pokemon Trading Card Game (TCG) mat and 
        a tablet PC via an RFID reader.  The Pokemon Card Coliseum provides players with a unique way to play the traditional Pokemon TCG, 
        displaying real time animation based on game play using 2D graphics.  The project engineers will design a Pokemon TCG mat with 
        integrated RFID reader to interface with an Android tablet, specifically a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet for the prototype.  During game 
        play, players will swipe Pokemon cards with RFID tags over the RFID reader and "into" the game, an Android application developed by 
        project engineers. This will allow the tablet to track and animate game play.  The design prototype will include a limited set of 
        Pokemon cards to demonstrate game play.  Five Pokemon, basic energy cards (Fighting, Fire, Grass, Lightning, Psychic, and Water), and 
        three trainer cards will be used.  The major components include an Android Tablet with 30-pin input, a USB-to-30-pin-input adapter, a 
        USB-out RFID reader, and a standard Pokemon TCG mat containing spaces for: a bench, active Pokemon, prize cards, the player’s deck, 
        and a discard pile.  The design team will demonstrate various aspects of play, showing the software cleanly handles varying aspects 
        of the card game and displaying relevant information to the user easily. The design of our GUI has been streamlined to include as few 
        buttons as possible, providing an immersive experience for users. </ul>
